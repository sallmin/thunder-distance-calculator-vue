Calculating the distance of a thunder is really easy. All you need it to count in seconds how long it takes for you to hear rumble after thunder has struck. Knowing that light travels approximately 300 000 km/s, or more than 6 times round the world in a second, we know that we see the light immediately upon striking. Sound travels at about 340 m/s in room temperature (20â„ƒ). To calculate the final distance of a thunder we just multiply seconds counted with speed of sound. Example: If we counted 5 seconds after thunder struck, and then multiply this number by 340 we get 1700 meters or 1.7 kilometers distance from a thunder
